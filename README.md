# bitcoin-current-price
NextJS Application to check bitcoin current price

1. Clone the repository
2. 
```bash
npm install

#then

npm run dev

```

Keep in mind that for this project we are making a GET request to a free service that allows us to show the current Bitcoin price 
so it's possible that the endpoint maybe could fail or the response could change.

This application is good for a quick reminder of how props work and how to make an ajax request from server side and pass information to components.
